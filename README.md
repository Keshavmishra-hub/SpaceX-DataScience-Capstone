# üöÄ SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis ‚Äî Data Science Capstone

This capstone project explores the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first-stage landing outcomes to determine if we can **predict a successful landing**, using historical launch data. The motivation stems from the cost savings SpaceX achieves through reusable rockets, significantly reducing the $165 million traditional launch cost to ~$62 million.
